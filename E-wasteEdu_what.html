                                <p class="about"> Electronic waste, or e-waste, refers to discarded electronic devices. These devices include old computers, smartphones, tablets, TVs, printers, and other electrical or electronic devices that are no longer in use.</p>
                                <p class="about">E-waste is a significant and growing global issue. With the rapid advancement of technology, electronic devices become obsolete at an alarming rate, leading to a surge in discarded electronics. Unfortunately, many people dispose of their old devices improperly, either by throwing them in the trash or storing them indefinitely.</p>

                            <h2 class="header">Why Is E-Waste A Concern?</h2>
                                <p class="about">E-waste contains hazardous materials such as lead, mercury, cadmium, and brominated flame retardants. When improperly disposed of, these substances can leach into the soil and water, posing serious health risks to humans and wildlife.<br></p>
                                <p class="about">Moreover, e-waste contributes to environmental pollution and resource depletion. Extracting raw materials for electronic devices involves significant energy consumption and environmental impact. By reducing e-waste generation and promoting recycling, we can minimize our ecological footprint and conserve valuable resources.</p>
